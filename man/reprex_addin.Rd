\usage{
reprex_addin()

reprex_selection(venue = getOption("reprex.venue", "gh"))
}
\arguments{
\item{venue}{Character. Must be one of the following (case insensitive):
\itemize{
\item "gh" for \href{https://github.github.com/gfm/}{GitHub-Flavored Markdown}, the
default
\item "r" for a runnable R script, with commented output interleaved
\item "rtf" for
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format}{Rich Text Format}
(not supported for un-reprexing)
\item "html" for an HTML fragment suitable for inclusion in a larger HTML
document (not supported for un-reprexing)
\item "so" for
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/editing-help#syntax-highlighting}{Stack Overflow Markdown}.
Note: this is just an alias for "gh", since Stack Overflow started to
support CommonMark-style fenced code blocks in January 2019.
\item "ds" for Discourse, e.g.,
\href{https://community.rstudio.com}{community.rstudio.com}. Note: this is
currently just an alias for "gh".
\item "plain-md" for simple, plain markdown without the \code{r} syntax highlighting
indicator on the opening backticks of fenced code blocks, and without the
advertising footer; useful anywhere plain simple
markdown is desired, but particularly useful for pasting inline within
Slack posts (as opposed to snippets).

\description{
\code{reprex_addin()} opens an \href{https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/gadgets.html}{RStudio gadget} and
\href{http://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/}{addin} that allows you to say
where the reprex source is (clipboard? current selection? active file?
other file?) and to control a few other arguments. Appears as "Render
reprex" in the RStudio Addins menu.

\code{reprex_selection()} is an
\href{http://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/}{addin} that reprexes the current
selection, optionally customised by options. Appears as "Reprex selection"
in the RStudio Addins menu. Heavy users might want to \href{https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206382178-Customizing-Keyboard-Shortcuts}{create a keyboard shortcut}.
