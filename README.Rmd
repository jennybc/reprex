## reprex

Prepare reproducible examples for posting to [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r), etc.

  * Given R code on the clipboard, in a file, or as expression,
  * run it via `rmarkdown::render()`,
  * with deliberate choices re: arguments and setup chunk.
  * Get resulting runnable code + output as markdown,
  * formatted for target venue, e.g. `gh` or `so`,
  * on the clipboard and, optionally, in a file.
  * Preview an HTML version in RStudio viewer or default browser.

## Install and load

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jennybc/reprex")
library(reprex)
```
  
```{r include = FALSE}
library(reprex)
```
  
## Quick start

Let's say you copy this code onto your clipboard:

```{r include = FALSE}
demo_code <- c(
  "(y <- 1:4)",
  "mean(y)"
)
writeLines(demo_code, "README-tmp.R")
```

```{r asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
cat(demo_code, sep = "\n")
```

Then call `reprex()`, where the default target venue is GitHub:

```{r eval = FALSE}
reprex()
```

A nicely rendered HTML preview will display in RStudio's Viewer (if you're in RStudio) or your default browser otherwise.

![html-preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/reprex/master/img/README-viewer-screenshot.png)

The relevant bit of GitHub-flavored Markdown is ready to be pasted from your clipboard:

```{r asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
md_content <-
  reprex(infile = "README-tmp.R", outfile = "README-tmp_gh", show = FALSE)
cat(md_content, sep = "\n")
```

Here's what that Markdown would look like rendered in a GitHub issue:

```{r child = "README-tmp_gh.md"}
```

Anyone else can copy, paste, and run this immediately.

But wait, there's more!

  * Set the target venue to Stack Overflow with `reprex(venue = "so")`.
  * By default, figures are uploaded to [imgur.com](http://imgur.com) and resulting URL is dropped into an inline image tag.
  * Alternatives to clipboard input:
    - `reprex(infile = "my_reprex.R")` gets the code from file
    - `reprex({(y <- 1:4); mean(y)})` gets code from expression

```{r include = FALSE}
leftovers <- list.files(pattern = "README-tmp", ignore.case = TRUE)
if (length(leftovers)) file.remove(leftovers)
```

## More control

Examples of how to take greater control of your reprex.

### knitr options

Supplement or override reprex defaults for [knitr chunk and package options](http://yihui.name/knitr/options/) via the arguments `opts_chunk` and `opts_knit`. Example: change the prefix used to comment out the output. This call:

```{r eval = FALSE}
reprex({y <- 1:4; mean(y)}, opts_chunk = list(comment = "#¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"))
```

```{r include = FALSE}
reprex({y <- 1:4; mean(y)}, opts_chunk = list(comment = "#¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"),
       show = FALSE, outfile = "README-tmp")
```

yields this output:

```{r child = "README-tmp.md"}
```

### Embedded prose

Sometime you want to mingle rendered code and prose. Put the embedded code in as roxygen comments, i.e. comment lines that start with `#'`. This reprex code:

```{r include = FALSE}
demo_code <- c(
  "## a regular comment",
  "x <- 1:100",
  "#' Here is some embedded prose, as a roxygen comment.",
  "mean(x)"
)
writeLines(demo_code, "README-tmp.R")
md_content <-
  reprex(infile = "README-tmp.R", outfile = "README-tmp_gh", show = FALSE)
```

```{r asis = TRUE, echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
cat(demo_code, sep = "\n")
```

renders to this this result:

```{r child = "README-tmp_gh.md"}
```

```{r cleanup, include = FALSE}
leftovers <- list.files(pattern = "README-tmp", ignore.case = TRUE)
if (length(leftovers)) file.remove(leftovers)
```

## What is a reprex?

What is a `reprex`? It's a {repr}oducible {ex}ample. Coined by Romain Francois [on twitter](https://twitter.com/romain_francois/status/530011023743655936).

Where and why are they used?

-   A Stack Overflow question that includes a proper reprex is [much more likely to get answered](http://stackoverflow.com/help/no-one-answers), by the most knowledgeable (and therefore busy!) people.
-   A [GitHub issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) that includes a proper reprex is more likely to achieve your goal: getting a bug fixed or getting a new feature, in a finite amount of time.

What are the main requirements?

  * Use the smallest, simplest, most [built-in data](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) possible.
    - Think: `iris` or `mtcars`. Bore me.
    - If you must make some objects, minimize their size and complexity.
    - Get just a bit of something with `head()` or by indexing with the result of `sample()`. If anything is random, consider using `set.seed()` to make it repeatable.
    - `dput()` is a good way to get the code to create an object you have lying around. Copy and paste the *result* of this into your reprex. *(We might try to facilitate this in future, see [#7](https://github.com/jennybc/reprex/issues/7).)*
    - Look at official examples and try to write in that style. Consider adapting one.
  * Include commands on a strict "need to run" basis.
    - Ruthlessly strip out anything unrelated to the specific matter at hand.
    - Include every single command that is required, e.g. loading specific packages via `library(foo)`.
  * Consider including so-called "session info", i.e. your OS and versions of R version and add-on packages, if it's conceivable that it matters. Use `reprex(..., si = TRUE)` for this.
  * Pack it in, pack it out, and don't take liberties with other people's computers.
    - If you change options, store original values at the start, do your thing, then restore them: `opar <- par(pch = 19) <blah blah blah> par(opar)`.
    - If you create files, delete them when you're done: `write(x, "foo.txt") <blah blah blah> file.remove("foo.txt")`.
    - Don't delete files or objects that you didn't create in the first place.
    - Don't mask built-in functions, i.e. don't define a new function named `c`.
    - Take advantage of R's built-in ability to create temporary files and directories. Read up on [`tempfile()` and `tempdir()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/tempfile.html).
  * Whitespace rationing is not in effect. Use good [coding style](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).
  
But won't that take time and effort?

  * Yes, yes it will!
  * 80% of the time you will solve your own problem in the course of writing an excellent reprex. YMMV.
  * The remaining 20% of the time, you will create a reprex that is more likely to elicit the desired behavior in others.

  * [How to write a reproducible example](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html) from Hadley Wickham's [Advanced R book](http://adv-r.had.co.nz)

## Package philosophy

The reprex code:

  * Must run and, therefore, should be run **by the person posting**. No faking it.
  * Should be easy for others to digest, so **they don't necessarily have to run it**. You are encouraged to include selected bits of output. :scream:
  * Should be easy for others to copy + paste + run, **iff they so choose**. Don't let inclusion of output break executability.

Accomplished like so:

  * use `rmarkdown::render` or, under the hood, `knitr::spin` to run the code and capture output that would display in R console
  * use chunk option `comment = "#>"` to include the output while retaining executability
